## 🏗️ Working Process

<details>
    <summary><strong>Data Processing and Verification</strong></summary>

```bash
python process.py form
```

It is designed for efficient processing and verification of student data collected from various institutions. The code begins by extracting details about the institution and student from files situated in "input" directory. The subsequent data processing steps involve cleaning and normalizing student information for accurate analysis.

One notable feature is the district guessing mechanism based on the IFSC codes associated with student data. The script intelligently suggests a potential district, allowing users to verify or override the district manually. The processed data is then printed for review.

The verification section prompts the user to confirm the accuracy of the student data. Upon successful verification, the script marks the data as correct and organizes it into a directory corresponding to the selected or guessed district. In cases of incorrect formatting, the script identifies errors, allowing for manual investigation and reformatting.

This script streamlines the workflow of handling student information, ensuring data accuracy and facilitating organized storage based on district categorization.

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Data Verification and Database Integration</strong></summary>

```bash
python process.py database
```

It is designed to be used after organizing forms by executing `process forms`. The primary focus is on verifying the correctness of student data and integrating it into a database. The script begins by checking if the file adheres to the correct format. If the format is correct, the user is prompted to specify the district for the organized data, with the option to automatically determine it based on the Indian state if unspecified.

The script then prints details about the institution and the processed student data for review. The verification section allows the user to confirm the accuracy of the data. Upon successful verification, the script marks the data as correct and proceeds to write it into the database. The user is notified of the success or rejection by the database, and the corresponding actions are taken. Verified data is moved to an output directory, while rejected data is moved to a separate directory for further investigation.

In cases of incorrect formatting, the script identifies errors, prompting the user for manual investigation and reformatting. This script provides a comprehensive solution for verifying and integrating student data into a database, ensuring data accuracy and facilitating efficient data management.

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>IFSC to Branch Converter</strong></summary>

```bash
python process.py ifsc
```

This tool simplifies the process of converting a list of IFSC codes to their corresponding branch names. Users can conveniently paste IFSC codes, and the script retrieves the associated branch names. The results are then copied to the clipboard for easy use. This tool streamlines the conversion task, providing a quick and efficient solution for handling IFSC data.

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Excel Spreadsheet Generator</strong></summary>

```bash
python process.py spreadsheet
```

This tool generates an Excel spreadsheet summarizing school and student information stored in database. The user specifies district name. The script dynamically fetches data based on the district, organizing it into a clear and structured spreadsheet. For each school, the spreadsheet includes institution details such as contact information and a list of students with their names, classes, account numbers, branches, and amounts.

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>NEFT Format Generator for School Data</strong></summary>

```bash
python process.py neft
```

This tool generates a spreadsheet in the NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) format, summarizing student's banking information stored in database. Users provide the district name. The script dynamically fetches data based on the district, organizing it into a structured spreadsheet compatible with NEFT standards. The generated spreadsheet includes essential details such as account numbers, account types, account titles, addresses, IFSC codes, and transaction amounts for each student.

## 🔎 How it works

### Process Forms

Processes student forms by parsing, segregating student and institution details, cleaning the imported data, inferring the institution's district, checking and standardizing student class information, displaying the data for user validation, and then sorting validated forms into a designated directory, while directing unvalidated forms for further scrutiny or manual inspection.

Command:

```
process form
```

Algorithm:

1. Initialize Input Directory
2. Get file list of supported extensions
3. If Form is of correct format, parse data
4. Separate out Student Details and Institution Details
5. Clean up imported data
6. Guess District of the Institution
7. Check if Student class are identifiable
8. If Student class are identifiable, normalize to Integer equivalents
9. Print data and check for user validation
10. If validated, sort form into [district] directory after validation
11. else, sort form into directory for checking

### Process Database

This algorithm begins by obtaining the district information from the user and initializing the directory corresponding to that district. It then retrieves a list of verified forms within the district's directory. For each form, it extracts both institution and student data, presenting this data for user validation. The algorithm subsequently adds the validated data into a database and commits the changes. If the data is successfully committed, the form is moved into a directory named after the current date in ISO format ([ISO_Date]); otherwise, the form is relocated to a separate directory named [rejected].

Command:

```
process database
```

Algorithm:

1. Get district from user and initialize [district] directory
2. Get list of verified forms inside [district] directory
3. For each form, load Institution data and Student data
4. Print data and ask for re-validation
5. Add both data into database and commit
6. If data is committed, move form into [ISO_Date] directory
7. Else move into [rejected] directory

### Process IFSC

Command:

```
process ifsc
```

## 📚 Libraries Used

Instead of Re-Inventing the wheel, let's use a premade module for simplicity.
Let's follow the path of the people who went before.

### DOCX Module

```
pip install python-docx
```

The python-docx library is one of the most popular and widely used libraries for working with DOCX (Microsoft Word) files in Python. It provides a comprehensive set of features for creating, modifying, and extracting information from DOCX files. For many use cases, it is indeed an excellent choice.
The python-docx library is well-documented and has a strong user community, making it a reliable choice for most tasks involving DOCX files.

### PDF Plumber

To extract information from PDFs with a specific structure, you can use Python libraries such as PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or Camelot. PyPDF2 primarily extracts raw text and doesn't provide as much layout information as pdfplumber. Therefore PDF Plumber is the best choice here.

```
pip install pdfplumber
```

#### PDF Plumber usage example

```py
import pdfplumber

# Replace 'your_pdf.pdf' with the path to your PDF file.
pdf_file = 'your_pdf.pdf'

with pdfplumber.open(pdf_file) as pdf:
    for page in pdf.pages:
        text = page.extract_text()

        # Check for the section headers and extract the content.
        if "Institution Details" in text:
            start = text.index("Institution Details")
            end = text.index("Student Details")
            institution_details = text[start:end]

        if "Student Details" in text:
            table = page.extract_table()

# Print or process the extracted information.
print("Institution Details:")
print(institution_details)

print("Student Details:")
print(student_details)
```

### Camelot

PDF Plumber might be better than PyPDF2 but, for table extractions, it gives unusable data.
Therefore Camelot is superior than PDF Plumber.
Camelot gives sophisticated controls for data extraction specifically.
Even though Camelot gives advanced control, we are still going to use pdf plumber as it provides basic extraction.

### RazorPay IFSC Dataset

The RazorPay IFSC Dataset is a comprehensive and up-to-date collection of Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) information, provided by RazorPay, a leading payment gateway and financial services company. This dataset contains detailed information about IFSC codes, which are unique identifiers for individual bank branches in India. It includes data such as bank names, branch names, addresses, and other relevant details.

## 📊 Data Analysis

### Class Data Conversion

(best approach would be to check similarity or REGEXP)

```py
std_dataset = {
    1: [ "1", "one", "1a", "1b", "1c", "1d", "1e", "i", "1st", "first" ],
    2: [ "2", "two" "2a", "2b", "2c", "2d", "2e", "11", "ii", "2nd", "second" ],
    3: [ "3", "three", "3a", "3b", "3c", "3d", "3e", "111", "iii", "3rd", "third" ],
    4: [ "4", "four", "4a", "4b", "4c", "4d", "4e", "1v", "iv", "4th", "fourth" ],
    5: [ "5", "five", "5a", "5b", "5c", "5d", "5e", "v", "5th", "fifth", ],
    6: [ "6", "six", "6a", "6b", "6c", "6d", "6e", "v1", "vi", "6th", "sixth", ],
    7: [ "7", "seven", "7a", "7b", "7c", "7d", "7e", "v11", "vii", "7th", "seventh", ],
    8: [ "8", "eight", "8a", "8b", "8c", "8d", "8e", "v111", "viii", "8th", "eighth", ],
    9: [ "9", "nine", "9a", "9b", "9c", "9d", "9e", "1x", "ix", "9th", "nineth", ],
    10: [ "10", "ten", "10a", "10b", "10c", "10d", "10e", "x", "10th", "tenth", ],
    11: [ "11", "x1", "xi", "11th", "plus one", "plusone", "+1", "+1 science", "+1 commerce", "+1 humanities", ],
    12: [ "12", "x11", "xii", "12th", "plus two", "plustwo", "+2", "+2 science", "+2 commerce", "+2 humanities", ],
    13: [ "1 dc", "1dc", "i dc", "idc", "ist dc", "1stdc", "1st dc" ],
    14: [ "2 dc", "2dc", "ii dc", "iidc", "iind dc", "2nddc", "2nd dc" ],
    15: [ "3 dc", "3dc", "iii dc", "iiidc", "iiird dc", "3rddc", "3rd dc" ],
    16: [ "1 pg", "1pg", "i pg", "ipg", "ist pg", "1st pg", "1stpg" ],
    17: [ "2 pg", "2pg", "ii pg", "iipg", "iind pg", "2ndpg", "2nd pg" ],
}
```

### District Recognition

1. Read all IFSC Code
2. Find District of all IFSC Code
3. Make a list out of districts
4. Find the most occuring value in the list
5. Return the value

```py
def most_common(a_list):
    from collections import Counter
    count = Counter(a_list)
    mostCommon = count.most_common(1)
    return mostCommon[0][0]
```

### District Recognition Algorithm 2.0

1. Store all IFSC Code into a List
2. For each IFSC Code, get CSV Record from RBI Dataset
3. Convert CSV Record into a List
4. Get Most Recurring Value (MRV) of the Record List
5. Compare Each MRV with District Dataset
6. Return first matching district for each IFSC Code
7. Store all return value into a list
8. Get (MRV) of the Return Value List

## 🛢️ Database Design

Tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Schools" (
	"SchoolID"	INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	"SchoolName"	TEXT NOT NULL,
	"District"	TEXT,
	"Place"	TEXT,
	"Phone"	TEXT,
	"Email"	TEXT,
	PRIMARY KEY("SchoolID" AUTOINCREMENT)
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID   INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    SchoolID    INTEGER REFERENCES Schools (SchoolID),
    StudentName TEXT    NOT NULL,
    Class       INTEGER NOT NULL,
    IFSC        TEXT    NOT NULL,
    AccNo       TEXT    NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    AccHolder   TEXT    NOT NULL,
    Branch      TEXT    NOT NULL,
    Verified    TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT (False),
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID AUTOINCREMENT),
    FOREIGN KEY (SchoolID) REFERENCES Schools (SchoolID)
);
```

Finding schools with students more than 20

```sql
SELECT Schools."SchoolID", Schools."SchoolName", COUNT(Students."StudentID") AS "TotalStudents"
FROM Schools
LEFT JOIN Students ON Schools."SchoolID" = Students."SchoolID"
GROUP BY Schools."SchoolID", Schools."SchoolName"
HAVING COUNT(Students."StudentID") > 12;
```

### ISO 3166-2 District Abbreviations

```
Local  ISO   District Name
--------------------------------
TVM    TV    Thiruvananthapuram
KLM    KL    Kollam
PTA    PT    Pathanamthitta
ALP    AL    Alappuzha
KTM    KT    Kottayam
IDK    ID    Idukki
EKM    ER    Ernakulam
TSR    TS    Thrissur
PKD    PL    Palakkad
MLP    MA    Malappuram
KKD    KZ    Kozhikode
WYD    WA    Wayanad
KNR    KN    Kannur
KSD    KS    Kasargod
```

### Account Number Validation

RBI dictates certain rules over Indian Bank Account Number structures (9 - 18).
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?ID=695#UAN

- Most of the banks have unique account numbers.
- Account number length varies from 9 digits to 18 digits.
- Most of the banks (67 out of 78) have included branch code as part of the account number structure. Some banks have product code as part of the account number structure.
- 40 out of 78 banks do not have check digit as part of the account number structure.
- All banks have purely numeric account numbers, except one or two foreign banks.
- Only in the case of 20 banks, account numbers are formed without any pattern with a unique running serial number.

Indian Bank Account Number Validation Regex:

```
^\d{9,18}$
```

A better way to validate would be to select the right bank and then have checks in place as per the bank which have been outlined and analyzed by the RBI here:
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?ID=695#A3

## 🚨 Problems Faced

### Cyclomatic Complexity too high

To reduce cyclomatic complexity, we have to reduce the number of if, else, for loops etc.
In main(), there are multiple conditions checking for executing different commands passed.

```python
    # Command List
    cmd_db = "database"
    cmd_form = "forms"
    cmd_ifsc = "ifsc"
    cmd_excel = "spreadsheet"
    cmd_bank = "neft"

    # PROCESS BRANCH
    if command == cmd_ifsc:
        # do ifsc stuffs
    if command == cmd_excel:
        # do excel stuffs
    . . .
```

All these multiple command checking can be reduced by implementing a simple State Transition Machine.
Before doing that, all the functions here needs to be encapsulated for modularity.

### Real World Findings

- Many Schools uses open document formats (FOSS FTW)
- Formatting Issues might most likely be Colleges (due to class validation). Remember, no. of colleges are sparse unlike schools.

#### 1. Form

##### DOCX Document Form (Current method)

Initially, word .docx format was chosen for form as it is the most commonly used format and therefore can be able to reach much wider audience.
Rules and regulations are visible immediately on top of the form which aids in correct form filling procedures.
All they have to do is, fill the form, save and sumbit it for further processing.
This way of sending forms also gives flexibility when it comes to privacy. Those who prefers privacy can send it via personal email.
Problem 1: Missing label "District" could impact the accuracy of sorting form based on districts
Problem 2: Digital document like .docx might not be that accessible in poorer areas.

##### Google Document

This is a google docs version of DOCX Form. With this version, the sharing URL is taken for distribution.
The "edit" at the end of URL is replaced with "copy" for obtaining the copy of Form for users rather than editing the original form.
This can be useful for increasing accessability to users who are in poorer areas without a computer.
Problem 1: Sharing requires some level of technical expertise.
